# Tasks application UI
This repository contains source code for tasks tracking application UI. This application is inspired by [Anton Aheichanka](https://dribbble.com/shots/1956586-Filter-Menu) design, and I implemented by using [Bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc) and sample animations with some mocked data.
